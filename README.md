<h3>üìù About My Project:</h3>
This project is a survey polling website built using React, React Router, Firebase, Tanstack Query, Axios, and MongoDB, with styling done using Tailwind CSS.

- **1.Interactive Surveys:**: Engage users with dynamic and interactive survey forms built using React.
- **2.Routing with React Router:**:Implement seamless navigation and enhance user experience with React Router for smooth page transitions.
- **3.Real-time Database with Firebase:**: Leverage Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval, ensuring instant updates to survey responses.
- **4.Efficient Data Handling with Tanstack Query:**: MUtilize Tanstack Query for efficient state management and seamless integration with MongoDB.
- **5.External API Communication with Axios:**: Easily connect to external APIs to enrich survey data and provide a comprehensive user experience.

<h2>üöÄWrite challenges faced for the backend Code  </h2>
Building the backend for a Survey Polling application using MongoDB, CORS, dotenv, and Express presented a set of challenges, each met with strategic solutions to ensure a robust and scalable system.

- **1.MongoDB Integration:**: Integrating MongoDB involved establishing a seamless connection, designing a schema to store survey data efficiently, and implementing CRUD operations.
  -Solution: Implemented the official MongoDB Node.js driver, created models for surveys, and utilized indexing for efficient querying. This ensured a reliable connection and optimized data retrieval.

- **2.CORS Configuration:**:Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be a challenge when the frontend and backend are on different domains, leading to security restrictions.
  -Solution: Integrated the CORS middleware in Express to define the allowed origins, headers, and methods. This ensured a secure and controlled environment for cross-origin requests.

- **3.dotenv for Environment Variables:**: Managing sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, securely without hardcoding them in the code.
  -Solution: Utilized the dotenv library to load environment variables from a .env file, ensuring secure storage of sensitive information and facilitating easy configuration changes.

- **4.Express Routing and Middleware:**: Designing clear and maintainable routes for survey-related operations, implementing middleware for authentication, and handling errors gracefully.

-Solution: Structured Express routes logically, used middleware for token-based authentication, and implemented error handling middleware. This promoted code modularity and improved overall maintainability.
